## 📊 Monitoring

### Daily Monitoring

Check these daily:

1. **Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Check Status is "Running"
   - Check for any deployment errors

2. **View Logs**
   ```bash
   railway logs --follow
   ```
   Look for:
   - ✅ "Bot running in webhook mode"
   - ✅ "Database connected"
   - ✅ "Webhook set"
   - ❌ No error messages

3. **Test Bot Functionality**
   - Message bot: `/start`
   - Create a test
   - View your tests
   - Verify everything works

### Weekly Monitoring

1. **Check Resource Usage**
   - Railway Dashboard → Metrics
   - Monitor CPU, Memory, Disk usage
   - Should be very low (< 5%)

2. **Review Logs for Errors**
   - Check for any error patterns
   - Look for database connection issues
   - Monitor for rate limiting

3. **Database Health**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
   ```
   - Monitor user count growth
   - Check database size

### Monthly Maintenance

1. **Update Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm outdated
   npm update
   ```

2. **Review Credentials**
   - Check if bot token should be rotated
   - Verify database password security

3. **Database Backup**
   - Neon auto-backs up, but verify
   - Export important data if needed

psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';"

# Check total tests created
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tests;"

# Check most active user
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM tests GROUP BY user_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Production

### Bot Stopped Responding

1. **Check Railway**
   ```bash
   railway logs --follow
   ```

2. **Check Deployment**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - See if there's a new deployment
   - Check if it failed

3. **Restart Bot**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click "Restart"

4. **Check Database**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```

### High Latency

1. **Check Railway Metrics**
   - Monitor CPU and Memory
   - Check if nearing limits

2. **Optimize Queries**
   - Check database indexes
   - Review slow queries

3. **Scale if Needed**
   - Railway can auto-scale
   - Contact Railway support

### Database Connection Errors

1. **Verify Connection String**
   - Check DATABASE_URL in Railway
   - Make sure it hasn't expired

2. **Check Neon**
   - Log in to Neon dashboard
   - Verify database is running
   - Check firewall rules

3. **Test Connection**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1;"
   ```
