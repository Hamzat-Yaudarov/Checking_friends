## Deployment Questions

### Q: How do I deploy the bot?
**A:** See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for step-by-step instructions.

### Q: What are environment variables?
**A:** They're settings stored outside your code (in Railway or .env file). They contain sensitive info like:
- Bot token
- Database connection string
- Environment type

See [ENV_CONFIG.md](./ENV_CONFIG.md) for details.

### Q: Where do I get the bot token?
**A:** Create a new bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.

### Q: Where do I get the database connection string?
**A:** Create a new project on [Neon](https://neon.tech) and copy the connection string.

### Q: How do I know if deployment worked?
**A:** 
1. Check Railway logs
2. Open Telegram and message your bot
3. Send `/start` - you should see a response

### Q: Can I deploy without GitHub?
**A:** Not with the current setup. You need GitHub to use Railway's automatic deployments.

## Troubleshooting

### Q: Bot doesn't respond to /start
**A:** 
- Check bot token is correct
- Verify database is accessible
- Check Railway logs for errors

### Q: "Cannot connect to database" error
**A:**

- Check Neon dashboard
- Ensure connection string hasn't expired

### Q: TypeScript compilation errors
**A:**
```bash

npm install
npm run build
```

### Q: Bot token is wrong/invalid
**A:**
- Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

### Q: Can't find my test
**A:**
- Click "üìã –ú–æ–∏ —Ç–µ—Å—Ç—ã"
- Look for your test in the list
- If not there, you need to create it first

### Q: Deleted a test by accident
**A:** Unfortunately, there's no undo. You'll need to create a new test.
